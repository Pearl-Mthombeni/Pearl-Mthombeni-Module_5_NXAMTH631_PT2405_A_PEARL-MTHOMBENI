Welcome to my Blackjack game! As a beginner coder, I created this project to learn more about JavaScript programming and apply skills I have picked up with HTML and CSS. This game allows you to play Blackjack against a computer dealer. Working on this project has helped me understand how to use JavaScript for game development, how to manage game logic and user input, basic concepts of randomness and probability. The goal of the game is to get close to but never as far as 21 points. Face cards are worth 10 points, Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points and all other cards are worth their face value. I am excited to continue learning and improving my coding skills, I plan on editing and adding new features in the future. Thank you for checking out my project! Any feedback, constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome!
